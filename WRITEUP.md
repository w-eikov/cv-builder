# Pathbuddy WEX: CV builder
## Final Writeup
We have successfully built a working CV/Cover Letter builder using a **Python Flask, HTML Jinja2, JavaScript and CSS**. This web-hosted CV builder allows for a user to generate/download CVs and Cover Letters with minimal effort and ease of access.

 Taking into consideration a user’s needs and wants, we have successfully implemented **OpenAI’s API** in generating a personalised Cover Letter, using a user’s information that they have provided. Furthermore, we have decided to only use **OpenAI’s API** in generating a Cover Letter, specifically NOT in generating a CV, since they are formulaic, only providing a bare-bones list of qualifications, achievements, etc… Generative AI would be much more suited for the narrative-led and expressive cover letter that would be used to demonstrate personality, motivation and other qualitative data. 

To demonstrate utmost convenience to the user, we have also allowed for the program to export generated CVs and Cover Letters as **PDFs** (Cover Letters can also be downloaded as **Word Documents**, suitable since they are articulately written and are highly personalised), allowing users to download and send them to their future employers.
